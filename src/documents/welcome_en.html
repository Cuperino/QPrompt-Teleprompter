<p>Thank you for using QPrompt!</p>
<p>QPrompt is a high-quality, feature-rich, open source teleprompter app, made with productivity and smooth performance in mind. It aims to solve the needs of teleprompter operators working in the events industry and of video content creators working individually or in small teams.<br></p>
<p>Licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">GNU General Public License v3</a>, QPrompt is free to use for any purpose, including commercial use.<br></p>
<p>An adjustable reading area helps ensure people's eyes face the camera instead of darting left and right, regardless of whether they're recording through a webcam or a studio teleprompter setup.<br></p>
<p>QPrompt's custom made rich text editor allows you to open and copy-paste formatted text from popular office suites. If you have <a href="https://libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> installed on your computer, QPrompt will leverage it in the background to open a wide variety of formats.<br></p>
<p>The opacity slider makes QPrompt’s background semi-transparent, which is useful for video conference calls and for displaying other apps in the background, such as a video monitoring feed or a count-down during new year’s eve.<br></p>
<p>Readers with dyslexia can greatly benefit from QPrompt thanks to the horizontal bars that highlight the reading area (our innovation, carried over from Imaginary Teleprompter), as well as the inclusion of the <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/">OpenDyslexic</a> font.<br></p>
<p>Make changes on the fly by swiftly entering and leaving prompt mode, or by double clicking where you wish to edit while prompting. Double click again or press ESC to exit the “edit while prompting mode”.<br></p>
<p>Navigate quickly through your script with customizable keyboard shortcuts. Map these to match other devices that act as keyboard emulators, such as presentation clickers and Contour Shuttle Controllers. Use key mapping in combination with <a href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/">KDE Connect’s</a> presentation mode to control the velocity through your phone.<br></p>
<p>Named and nameless markers allow you to instantly jump to any predetermined location on the script. Assign a key-combo from your keyboard, pressing those keys while prompting will jump the prompter to your desired location.<br></p>
<p>Built-in chronometer let's you time your scripts and computes the time to reach the end of the scripts.<br></p>
<p>While nothing beats dedicated hardware for screen duplication. However QPrompt let's you prompt to multiple screens connected to your computer. For dedicated hardware for screen duplication, we recommend <a href="https://decimator.com/">Decimator</a>. We are not sponsored by them, but members of our community love their screen duplicators.<br></p>
<p>Thanks to a worldwide community, QPrompt is available in many of the world's most commonly spoken languages. German, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Chinese, Czech, Ukranian and Russian have fairly complete translations. You can <a href="https://l10n.cuperino.com/">contribute translations</a> if you like.<br></p>
<p>In addition to being translated, QPrompt comes with fonts that allow you to prompt text in writing systems of over 180 languages. RTL writing systems are officially supported.<br></p>
<p>Presently, due to the lack of support for the <a href="https://mosprotocol.com/">MOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.ndi.video/all/developing-with-ndi/introduction">NDI</a> protocols, QPrompt v2.0 is not recommended for use in traditional newsroom environments. If you're interested in supporting the development of these features, please reach out.</p>
