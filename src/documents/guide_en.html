<p>Thank you for using QPrompt!</p>
<p><a href="#">QPrompt</a> takes the stress away from teleprompter operation, so you can enjoy media production and avoid dealing with memorization.</p>
<p>Our goal with QPrompt is to make it easy to operate a teleprompter, while maximizing productivity, performance, and control accuracy.</p>
<p>QPrompt is free software as defined by the FSF<!--<a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">FSF</a>-->; meaning you're free to share, study, and modify QPrompt to your needs.</p>

<p>QPrompt is pronounced "Q" "Prompt". The name is short for Cue Prompter, something said to cue teleprompter operators. Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things plus the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.<br></p>
<p>QPrompt is developed and maintained by Javier Cordero, also known as Cuperino, with the help of users like you, who give valuable feedback, translate QPrompt, and help test betas. Special thanks to my moral supporters and my family, the KDE Project and The Qt Company for their great frameworks, and I-Corps and KDAB for their education. You made this possible!</p>
