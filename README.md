# Priorities

There's a large backlog of feature requests, and a few bug reports, most of which are things that take time to develop. I don't mean to Curb Your Enthusiasm, but before you ask how long will it take for X feature to make it into QPrompt, you should know how we organize our priorities:

1. Tech support. We help everyone who asks for help first, to the extent that we can.
2. The most recent bugs reports are then addressed.
3. Then code contributions are addressed to ensure they can make it into QPrompt and that they'll work well on the supported platforms.
4. I then move to work on the older bugs that people continue to ask about.
5. Then onto adding the new features that have been voted for by Patreon supporters.
6. If I don’t have the time to work on the voted issues, because they’d take more time than I can allot, but I have enough time to work on something small, I take on a smaller task from the queue that either has high demand, requires a skill that I would like to work with, can be added very quickly, or that has been requested by a Patreon supporter.
7. On occasions, I contribute to the upstream projects to which QPrompt depends on, fixing issues and writing detailed bug reports.
8. Periodically, time is also set aside to maintain the IT infrastructure, make new builds (which on average take 2 days to make), and update users following our social media, and our websites.

QPrompt's supporters, of which Patreons are a small part of, have a lot of influence over what I choose to work on. Supporters include code contributors, documentation writers, translators, people who I know use the software actively and provide occasional feedback, and beta testers.

# Pun Facts
QPrompt is short for Cue Prompter, something said to cue teleprompter operators. Teleprompters are sometimes referred to as "autocue". Also, QPrompt is built using the Qt framework. The Q is meant to reference all of these things and also the word "quick", because teleprompter operators must be quick to respond to what happens on set.

QPrompt, this app, is not related in any way to Q-Prompt Inc. nor is it to be confused with Qprompt, the Python library, or CuePrompter, the teleprompter software.
